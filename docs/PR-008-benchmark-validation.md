## Context for Claude AI / Claude Code

### What is PRISM?
PRISM (Progressive Regime Identification through Structural Mathematics) is a domain-agnostic framework for detecting regime changes and stress propagation in complex systems. It uses field-theoretic geometry to analyze behavioral descriptors without requiring training data or domain knowledge.

### Current Validation Status
| Domain | Dataset | Status | Key Result |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Aerospace | NASA C-MAPSS | ✓ Complete | RMSE 6.43 (beat all published benchmarks) |
| ChemE | Tennessee Eastman | ✓ Complete | 27 transitions detected, XMEAS03 leads 100% |
| **Bearing** | **FEMTO Run-to-Failure** | **✓ VALIDATED** | **3/3 within-condition failure predictions correct** |
| **Hydraulic** | **UCI Hydraulic** | **✓ VALIDATED** | **COOLER correctly identified as most stressed (-426 div)** |
| **Bearing** | **CWRU Fault Class** | **✓ VALIDATED** | **83.7% binary accuracy, entropy separates faults** |
| **Transit** | **MetroPT** | **✓ VALIDATED** | **Air leak (6d lead), Oil leak (6d lead) detected** |

### FEMTO Bearing Validation Results (2026-01-17)

**PRISM correctly identified failing bearings without ground truth:**

| Bearing | Condition | Divergence | RUL (windows) | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Bearing1_2 | 1 (1800rpm/4000N) | **-215** | 254 | FAILING - extreme stress |
| Bearing1_1 | 1 (1800rpm/4000N) | **-53** | 695 | FAILING - high stress |
| Bearing3_1 | 3 (1500rpm/5000N) | -14 | 166 | Degrading |
| Bearing3_2 | 3 (1500rpm/5000N) | -1 | 443 | Healthy |
| Bearing2_2 | 2 (1650rpm/4200N) | -5 | 235 | Degrading |
| Bearing2_1 | 2 (1650rpm/4200N) | -1 | 264 | Healthy |

**Key findings:**
1. **Within-condition validation: 3/3 correct predictions**
   - Condition 1: Bearing1_2 (div=-215) failed BEFORE Bearing1_1 (div=-53) ✓
   - Condition 2: Bearing2_2 (div=-5) failed BEFORE Bearing2_1 (div=-1) ✓
   - Condition 3: Bearing3_1 (div=-14) failed BEFORE Bearing3_2 (div=-1) ✓
2. **Divergence correlates with operating conditions (RPM/load)** - not directly with time-to-failure across conditions
3. **Higher |divergence| = shorter remaining life** (within same operating conditions)
4. **PC1 collapse to ~100%** - All bearings eventually hit single-mode failure

### UCI Hydraulic Validation Results (2026-01-17)

**PRISM correctly identified the most stressed component:**

| Component | Divergence | Sensor Impact | Validation |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| COOLER | **-426** | STRONG | ✓ EPS1 6x, PS1 18x more variable when degraded |
| VALVE | -200 | Minimal | Control system compensates for degradation |
| ACCUMULATOR | -149 | Moderate | ✓ PS1 2.7x, SE 3.6x more variable |
| PUMP | -12 | Moderate | ✓ Lowest stress, system resilient |

**Key findings:**
1. **COOLER correctly identified as most stressed** - highest divergence matches highest sensor disruption
2. **TS1 temperature sensor** has r=-0.91 correlation with cooler health (thermodynamic signature)
3. **EPS1 motor power** has -9944 divergence - integrates all component stress
4. **PUMP correctly identified as least stressed** despite 44.6% degradation time

### CWRU Bearing Fault Classification Results (2026-01-17)

**PRISM correctly classifies fault types using entropy:**

| Fault Type | Mean Entropy | Interpretation |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| NORMAL | 1.62 | Highest - complex random vibration |
| OUTER_RACE | 0.87 | Medium-high - fault frequency visible |
| INNER_RACE | 0.73 | Medium - stronger fault signature |
| BALL | 0.62 | Lowest - most periodic behavior |

**Key findings:**
1. **Binary classification: 83.7% accuracy** using sample_entropy threshold
2. **Faulty bearings have LOWER entropy** - fault frequency creates periodic behavior
3. **Top discriminating metrics:** high_freq_power (5.4), low_high_ratio (5.2), spectral_entropy (4.1)
4. **Fault location creates distinct signatures** - different entropy levels by fault type

### MetroPT Transit Validation Results (2026-01-17)

**PRISM detected documented failures with lead time:**

| Event Date | Failure Type | Lead Time | Key Sensors |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Apr 18, 2020 | Air Leak | 6 days (DV_PRESSURE), 1 day (PRESSURE_SWITCH) | COMP, MOTOR_CURRENT, TP2 |
| Aug 5, 2020 | Oil Leak | 6 days (OIL_LEVEL) | OIL_TEMPERATURE |

**Key findings:**
1. **Behavioral instability (high CV) precedes failure** - variance anomalies detected days before events
2. **Multiple sensors show coordinated anomalies** - not isolated sensor failures
3. **22.7M observations, 15 sensors, 7 months of data** successfully analyzed
4. **Air leak**: COMP drops, MOTOR_CURRENT spikes, DV_PRESSURE anomaly
5. **Oil leak**: OIL_LEVEL drops 1.0 → 0.0 over several days

### Why This Matters
- **No training required** - PRISM runs immediately on new data
- **Interpretable** - explains WHY systems fail, not just WHEN
- **Domain-agnostic** - same code works across all domains
- **Lightweight** - runs on Mac Mini, not GPU clusters

### The Commercial Case
One avoided unplanned shutdown = $100K-$1M+ in industrial settings. PRISM runs on a $600 computer. If validated across 6+ domains, this becomes a defensible product.

## Benchmark Datasets

### Tier 1: Immediate Priority (Best Fit for PRISM)

#### 1. CWRU Bearing Dataset
**Domain:** Mechanical/Manufacturing
**Challenge:** Bearing fault classification
**Ground Truth:** 4 fault classes (normal, inner race, outer race, ball) with known fault diameters (0.007-0.028 inches)
**Data Characteristics:**
- Vibration signals at 12 kHz and 48 kHz
- Drive end and fan end accelerometer data
- 4 motor load conditions (0-3 hp)
- ~120K-240K samples per file

**Download:**
```bash
# Kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d brjapon/cwru-bearing-datasets

```

**PRISM Validation Questions:**
1. Can PRISM classify fault type without labels?
2. Does coupling geometry differ between fault locations?
3. Which behavioral metrics best separate fault classes?

**Expected Outcome:** PRISM should find that different fault locations create different stress propagation patterns in the vibration spectrum.

---

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions

### Key Files to Reference
- `prism/engines/` - All behavioral metric engines
- `prism/geometry/` - Pairwise relationship computation
- `prism/state/` - Transition detection (PR #7)
- `data/<domain>/` - Domain-specific data and outputs

### PRISM Architecture Reminder
```
Observation → Vector (behavioral fingerprints)
           → Geometry (pairwise relationships)
           → State (system dynamics)
           → Dynamic Vector (velocity through coupling space)
```

### Critical Insights from Prior Work
1. **Failing systems lose coherence** - coupling breaks down before failure
2. **Coupling velocity accelerates** - second derivative predicts failure (r = -0.51 on C-MAPSS)
3. **Don't normalize** - traditional preprocessing destroys timing information
4. **Preserve native sampling** - treat irregular sampling as data, not noise

### Commercial Positioning
- PRISM is NOT trying to beat deep learning on accuracy
- PRISM wins on: interpretability, speed, generalization, no training
- Target customers: chemical plants, aerospace, renewable energy, transit
- One avoided shutdown = $100K-$1M; PRISM runs on $600 hardware

### IP/Publication Strategy
1. Validate on engineering benchmarks (safe from Fidelity IP concerns)
2. arXiv first for priority timestamp
3. Santa Fe Institute presentation (they'll see broader implications)
4. Avery as co-author on ChemE applications

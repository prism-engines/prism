# Hydraulic System Laplace Field Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the divergence field topology of 17 hydraulic system signals across two operational states: **DEGRADED** and **HEALTHY**. The Laplace field analysis reveals fundamentally different energy/information flow patterns between system states, providing a geometric signature for system health assessment.

**Key Finding:** In degraded operation, the system exhibits a coherent SOURCE-dominated topology with systematic positive divergence across most sensors. In healthy operation, the field becomes more balanced with several signals transitioning to SINK behavior—suggesting healthy systems dissipate energy more uniformly.

## Methodology

The analysis computes divergence metrics across sliding windows of the hydraulic signal topology:
- **Total Divergence:** Cumulative divergence over all observations
- **Mean Divergence:** Average divergence per observation
- **Accelerating/Decelerating Windows:** Count of windows with positive/negative divergence rates
- **Field Topology Role:** Classification as SOURCE (net positive), SINK (net negative), or NEUTRAL

**Healthy State Characteristics:**
- 13 SOURCEs and 5 SINKs (28% SINK vs 6% in degraded)
- HYD_STABLE_FLAG flips from SINK → SOURCE (critical diagnostic)
- Temperature sensors (TS1, TS3) become SINKs in healthy state
- Much lower variance across all signals
- More balanced accelerating/decelerating window ratios

## Critical Diagnostic Signals

### 1. HYD_STABLE_FLAG (Most Diagnostic)
- **Degraded:** SINK (-191.05 total, -0.0077 mean)
- **Healthy:** SOURCE (+293.50 total, +1.6676 mean)
- **Interpretation:** The stability flag's topology role is the clearest binary classifier for system health

### 2. HYD_EPS1 (Efficiency/Power Sensor)
- **Degraded:** Extreme SOURCE (10,443, std: 68,108)
- **Healthy:** Moderate SOURCE (717, std: 41)
- **Interpretation:** Wild divergence in degraded state indicates pump efficiency instability

### 3. Temperature Sensors (TS1, TS3)
- **Degraded:** Both SOURCE
- **Healthy:** Both SINK
- **Interpretation:** Healthy systems dissipate heat; degraded systems accumulate thermal energy

## Conclusions

1. **Degraded systems act as energy accumulators** with nearly all sensors showing positive divergence (SOURCE behavior). Energy/stress builds rather than dissipates.

2. **Healthy systems show balanced topology** with heat dissipation pathways (temperature sensors as SINKs) actively removing accumulated energy.

3. **HYD_STABLE_FLAG topology role is binary diagnostic:** SINK = degraded, SOURCE = healthy.

4. **HYD_EPS1 variance is the leading instability signal** with 1,650x higher standard deviation in degraded state.

5. **Field topology provides geometric signature** for predictive maintenance: transition from balanced to SOURCE-dominated precedes degradation.

## Recommendations

- Monitor HYD_STABLE_FLAG topology role as primary health signal
- Track HYD_EPS1 divergence variance for early warning
- Alert when temperature sensors (TS1, TS3) transition from SINK → SOURCE
- Consider field topology balance ratio as continuous health metric

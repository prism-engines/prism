## Tier 1: High Impact, PRISM-Ready

### 1. Sepsis Early Warning (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Detect sepsis 6 hours before clinical diagnosis |
| **Why Unsolved** | Current models not reliable enough for clinical use. People die daily. |
| **Data** | MIMIC-IV (PhysioNet) - 60K+ ICU stays, free |
| **Signals** | HR, BP, temp, O2, respiratory rate, labs (~15 channels) |
| **PRISM Fit** | Regime detection on vitals. "Stable → Deteriorating → Septic" |
| **Size** | ~2-3 GB, Mac Mini friendly |
| **Outcome** | Life or death. Hospitals will pay. |
| **Prize/Value** | No formal prize - but massive commercial value |

**PRISM Approach:**
```
Each ICU stay → PRISM characterization (per vital sign)
Features: hurst, entropy, lyapunov, divergence per channel
Geometry: cohesion of vitals (do they decouple before sepsis?)
Target: Sepsis onset label
Model: Random Forest on PRISM features
```

**Why PRISM Wins:**
- Sepsis is a **regime transition** - PRISM's specialty
- Vitals **decouple** before crash - geometry detects this
- Explainable: "HR entropy spiked, BP-temp coherence dropped"

### 2. Battery Degradation (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Predict remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries |
| **Why Unsolved** | Tesla, everyone still guessing. Billions at stake. |
| **Data** | NASA Battery Dataset, CALCE, Oxford Battery |
| **Signals** | Voltage, current, temperature, capacity per cycle |
| **PRISM Fit** | Identical to C-MAPSS. Degradation = regime transition. |
| **Size** | Small datasets, trivial compute |
| **Outcome** | EV range prediction, grid storage, phones |
| **Prize/Value** | Industry contracts, massive commercial |

**PRISM Approach:**
```
Same as C-MAPSS:
Cycles → PRISM features → RUL prediction
Already beat NASA on turbofans. Batteries are easier.
```

**Why PRISM Wins:**
- You already proved this works on degradation prediction
- Same physics: system deteriorates, signatures change
- Direct translation from C-MAPSS methodology

### 3. Power Grid Stability (⭐⭐⭐⭐)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Predict blackouts/instability before they cascade |
| **Why Unsolved** | Texas 2021, California rolling blackouts, still happens |
| **Data** | UCI Electrical Grid Stability, various utility datasets |
| **Signals** | Frequency, voltage, load, generation across nodes |
| **PRISM Fit** | Source/sink topology IS the grid. Generation=sources, consumption=sinks. |
| **Size** | Moderate, Mac Mini OK |
| **Outcome** | Prevent cascading failures |
| **Prize/Value** | DOE funding, utility contracts |

**PRISM Approach:**
```
Grid nodes → PRISM characterization
Divergence topology: Who's sourcing, who's sinking?
Geometry: Network stress before cascade
Trigger: Imbalance detection → alert
```

**Why PRISM Wins:**
- PRISM's divergence topology **is** power flow
- You're literally measuring sources and sinks
- Tennessee Eastman validation proves process monitoring works

## Tier 2: High Impact, Moderate Fit

### 4. Earthquake Early Warning (⭐⭐⭐)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Seconds to minutes of warning before major quake |
| **Why Unsolved** | Japan gets seconds. Prediction is basically impossible. |
| **Data** | USGS earthquake catalog, seismic networks |
| **Signals** | Seismometer readings, foreshock patterns |
| **PRISM Fit** | Regime detection in seismic signals |
| **Size** | Can be large, needs filtering |
| **Outcome** | Seconds save lives |
| **Prize/Value** | Government contracts, humanitarian |

**PRISM Approach:**
```
Seismic stations → PRISM characterization
Look for: entropy changes, coherence across stations
Foreshock patterns → regime transition detection
```

**Challenges:**
- Signal is sparse (events are rare)
- Noise is high
- Prediction vs detection distinction

### 5. Wildfire Spread (⭐⭐)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Predict fire spread for evacuation/resource deployment |
| **Why Unsolved** | California burns every year |
| **Data** | Satellite, weather, fuel moisture |
| **Signals** | Temp, humidity, wind, fuel, terrain |
| **PRISM Fit** | More spatial than temporal. Not ideal. |
| **Size** | Large imagery data |
| **Outcome** | Save lives, property |
| **Prize/Value** | XPRIZE $11M, government contracts |

**PRISM Approach:**
```
Signal of fire perimeter growth
Weather regime detection
Fuel condition characterization
```

**Challenges:**
- Primarily spatial problem
- PRISM is temporal-focused
- Would need adaptation

## The Pitch

For any of these:

> "We built a physics-based feature engineering framework that extracts 60 interpretable metrics from signal topology data. It beat NASA's benchmark on turbofan prognostics using a linear model. Every calculation has a step-by-step derivation document. We've validated on 8 different physical systems. Now we're applying it to [sepsis/batteries/grid/etc]."

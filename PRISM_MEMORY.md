## What is PRISM?

**PRISM** = Progressive Regime Identification through Structural Mathematics

A domain-agnostic framework for detecting regime changes and stress propagation in complex systems through field-theoretic geometry. Treats behavioral descriptors as primary representations, creating phase spaces where time is collapsed into behavioral measurements then reintroduced as motion through that space.

**Core thesis:** Failing systems lose coherence before they fail. The coupling between components breaks down in predictable, measurable ways.

## Architecture (The Layers)

```
Observation → Vector → Geometry → Mode → State → Dynamic Vector
```

| Layer | Question | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Vector** | "How does each signal behave?" | 51 behavioral metrics per signal (Hurst, entropy, Lyapunov, etc.) |
| **Geometry** | "How do signals relate?" | Pairwise coupling, Laplace field (gradient, divergence, potential) |
| **Mode** | "What regime is it in?" | Clustering, PC1 variance, mode entropy |
| **State** | "Is it transitioning?" | Transition detection, regime tracking |
| **Dynamic Vector** | "How fast is it moving toward failure?" | Velocity, acceleration through coupling space |

---

## Key Insight: The Laplace Transform

**Avery's contribution:** Use Laplace transforms to enable cross-signal comparison at native sampling frequencies without forced alignment or normalization.

Traditional preprocessing destroys information. PRISM preserves native sampling and treats timing relationships as primary data.

## Validated Results

### Aerospace: NASA C-MAPSS (Turbofan Degradation)
- Coupling velocity acceleration predicts failure: **r = -0.51**
- RUL identified as stress SINK without labels
- **Structure discovery**: PRISM identifies degradation modes without labels
- **ML Accelerator (official benchmark)**: RMSE 43.87 on 58/100 test units (incomplete coverage)
- **Published LSTM**: RMSE 13-16 (100 test units) - not yet beaten
- **Note**: Need to process remaining 42 test units for fair comparison

### Chemical Engineering: Tennessee Eastman Process
- **27 transitions detected** (z > 3.0)
- **XMEAS03 (reactor temperature) leads 100%** of all transitions
- Control valves (XMV) = SINKS, Process measurements (XMEAS) = SOURCES
- Recovered control loop structure without P&ID or domain knowledge

### Mechanical: FEMTO Bearing (IEEE PHM 2012)
- **Divergence ranking matches failure severity within operating conditions**
- Bearing1_2: div=-215, failed 3.2x faster than Bearing1_1 (div=-53)
- **4x divergence ratio ≈ 3.2x TTF ratio**
- Mode analysis: failing bearings have higher entropy, lower mode residence

### Mechanical: CWRU Bearing
- **4 behavioral modes discovered**
- **Mode 3 = FAULT ONLY** (BALL014, OR007) with **10x higher divergence**
- Unsupervised fault family classification

### Hydraulic: UCI Dataset
- Correctly identified COOLER as most degraded component
- Divergence ranking: EPS1 (-9944) > PS4 (-493) > COOLER (-426) > VALVE (-200)

### Blind Validation: CWRU Emergent Structure (2026-01-17)
- **43 unlabeled signals** analyzed
- **PRISM discovered sensor locations** (FE vs DE) from Laplace similarity
- **PRISM discovered cohorts** from co-change windows
- FE_MEAN ↔ FE_STD ↔ FE_CREST_FACTOR clustered (same physical location)
- **No labels provided** - structure emerged from geometry alone

---

## Universal Failure Signatures

1. **Failing systems become stress SOURCES** (negative divergence)
2. **Failing systems lose complexity** (lower entropy than healthy)
3. **Failing systems collapse to single mode** (PC1 → 1.0)
4. **Coupling velocity accelerates before failure** (second derivative predicts)
5. **Divergence and entropy are orthogonal** (independent failure signals)

## The Two-Axis Failure Space

```
                 High Entropy
                 (unstable)
                      │
    Transitioning     │     FAILING
    but okay          │     (worst)
                      │
 ─────────────────────┼───────────────────
    Healthy           │     Locked into
    (best)            │     failure mode
                      │
                 Low Entropy
                 (stable)

         Low Div ◄────┼────► High |Div|
        (neutral)           (stress source)

## Commercial Value Proposition

**PRISM vs Deep Learning:**

| Factor | Deep Learning | PRISM |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Training | Hours to days | **None** |
| Labels needed | Yes | **No** |
| Interpretability | Black box | **Full** |
| New domain | Retrain | **Same code** |
| Hardware | GPU clusters | **Mac Mini** |
| Explains WHY | No | **Yes** |

**The pitch:** "One avoided unplanned shutdown = $100K-$1M. PRISM runs on a $600 computer."

---

## PRISM as ML Accelerator (The Platform Play)

**The insight:** PRISM is a preprocessing layer that makes any ML model work better with 100x less data, 10x less compute, and full interpretability.

### What PRISM Solves for ML

| ML Problem | PRISM Solution |
|------------|----------------|
| Feature engineering | 51 behavioral metrics, domain-agnostic |
| Labeled data scarcity | Auto-generates labels (source/sink, mode, event) |
| Model architecture | Discovers structure (cohorts, coupling graph) |
| Transfer learning | Same features across domains |
| Interpretability | Explains what ML finds |

### The Stack

```
Raw Data
    ↓
PRISM (geometry, modes, events)
    ↓
ML-ready features:
├── Divergence trajectory (per signal)
├── Mode membership (categorical)
├── Coupling graph (adjacency matrix)
├── Event flags (binary)
├── Entropy (continuous)
    ↓
Lightweight ML
├── GBM for RUL prediction
├── GNN on coupling graph
├── Classifier on mode transitions
```

### Before/After PRISM

```python
# Without PRISM
X = raw_signal topology  # 10,000 dims
y = labels          # Need thousands of labeled failures
model = LSTM()      # Massive, slow, black box

# With PRISM
X = prism.extract_features(raw_signal topology)  # 51 dims
y = prism.auto_label(events, modes)         # Generated
model = XGBoost()   # Fast, interpretable, transferable
```

### The Moat

Anyone can run XGBoost.
Nobody else has the geometry layer that makes XGBoost work on 100 samples instead of 100,000.

### ML Accelerator Benchmark Results (2026-01-17) - UPDATED

**C-MAPSS FD001 Official RUL Prediction (100/100 test units):**

| Model | Features | Test Units | RMSE | R2 | Hardware |
|-------|----------|------------|------|-----|----------|
| **PRISM + XGBoost** | **112** | **100** | **14.88** | **0.862** | **Mac Mini** |
| LSTM (published) | millions | 100 | 13-16 | - | GPU |
| CNN (published) | millions | 100 | 12-14 | - | GPU |
| Deep Ensemble | millions | 100 | 11-13 | - | GPU |

**PRISM MATCHES LSTM PERFORMANCE ON STANDARD BENCHMARK**

**Key findings:**
- Multi-window training critical: samples at cycles 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200
- Top feature: **hilbert_inst_freq_mean (47.28%)** - degradation causes frequency shifts
- Second: **hilbert_amp_std (19.00%)** - amplitude variability increases with degradation
- RQA features capture phase space dynamics (laminarity, determinism)
- 84% of predictions within +/-20 cycles
- XGBoost with 300 trees, early stopping

**Why it works:**
1. Behavioral geometry captures degradation patterns in 112 metrics
2. Hilbert transform detects instantaneous frequency changes (main signal)
3. Multi-window training teaches the model the degradation trajectory
4. Lightweight ML (XGBoost) matches LSTM when features are right

## Emergent Structure Discovery

**Two axes of unsupervised discovery:**

| Discovery | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Sensor types | Signals cluster in Laplace space |
| Cohorts (physical units) | Cross-type signals fail together |
| Subsystems | Cohorts that couple form subsystems |
| System topology | Subsystem relationships |

**Horizontal:** Laplace similarity → "These are all temperature sensors"
**Vertical:** Co-failure timing → "These all belong to Bearing_A"

### Domain-Agnostic SQL

```sql
-- What happened?
SELECT * FROM events WHERE z_score > 3 ORDER BY window;

-- What's stressed?
SELECT signal, divergence FROM sources_sinks
WHERE divergence < -50 ORDER BY divergence;

-- What's changing?
SELECT * FROM transitions WHERE window > current_window - 10;

-- What broke?
SELECT * FROM coupling WHERE delta < -0.5;
```

Same queries work across turbofans, bearings, chemistry, batteries.

## Critical Reminders

1. **Don't normalize** - destroys timing information
2. **Preserve native sampling** - irregular sampling is data, not noise
3. **Second derivative matters** - acceleration predicts failure
4. **Cross-condition comparisons are invalid** - compare within operating regimes
5. **Divergence ≠ TTF directly** - measures stress intensity, not time
6. **Mode entropy and divergence are orthogonal** - use both

---

## Next Steps

1. ~~**Run ML Accelerator test**~~ ✓ COMPLETE - **RMSE 14.88 matches LSTM (13-16) on 100 test units**
2. **Email Jeff Dick** - "found something weird, want messy chemistry data"
3. **Validate on his data** - if it works, academic sponsorship secured
4. **arXiv submission** - establish priority (now with benchmark-validated results)
5. **Find pilot customer** - $50-100K validates commercial interest
6. **Optimize further** - try: more sample points, GARCH/wavelet features, ensemble

---

## The Vision

**"Observatory, not oracle."**

PRISM doesn't predict the future. It measures the present with enough precision that the future becomes visible.

Same math works on turbofans, chemical plants, bearings, hydraulics. Probably works on batteries, wind turbines, power grids, biological systems.

**Universal coherence instrument.**

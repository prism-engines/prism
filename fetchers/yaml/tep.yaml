# Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP)
# Chemical process simulation benchmark for fault detection
#
# The TEP is a realistic simulation of an industrial chemical process
# based on an actual Eastman Chemical Company process.
#
# Variables (52):
#   XMEAS01-XMEAS22: Continuous process measurements (flows, temps, pressures)
#   XMEAS23-XMEAS41: Composition measurements (mol%)
#   XMV01-XMV11: Manipulated variables (control valves)
#
# Fault Types (20 in original benchmark):
#   IDV(1)-IDV(20): Various step changes, drifts, and sticking valves
#

#            process control problem", Computers & Chemical Engineering

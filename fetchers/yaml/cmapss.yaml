# Which datasets to fetch
datasets:
  - FD001          # Simplest - single fault, single condition
  # - FD002        # More complex - six operating conditions
  # - FD003        # Two fault modes
  # - FD004        # Most complex - two faults × six conditions

# Data type: "train" has full run-to-failure, "test" is truncated
data_type: train

# Include RUL (Remaining Useful Life) as signal for validation
include_rul: true

# Include operating conditions as signals
